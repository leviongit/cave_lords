Welcome to Cave Lords!

This is just a community learning project for game dev in Ruby.

The game will attempt to be a top down, sprite-based, deep colony sim (think "Dwarf Fortress", "Rimworld", etc.). Except we'll be the "bad guys" in this one, playing orcs instead of those weirdo human creatures!

Nothing much to see here yet, but it's what we'll work on during the Coding with Chris live sessions.
